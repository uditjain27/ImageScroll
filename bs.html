                Coronavirus (Covid-19) India News Live Updates: With nearly 50,000 cases (48,916) on the second 
                consecutive day, the total number of coronavirus infections in India crossed the 13 lakh-mark to
                reach 13,36,861 on Saturday. Coronavirus India News Live Updates: India has ramped up its testing
                capacity for Covid-19 and conducted over 4.20 lakh — highest ever number of tests in a day, the 
                Union Health Ministry said Saturday, while crediting the increase in number of labs for the achievement.
                In January, India had only one testing lab for coronavirus which has now increased to 1,301, including 
                private labs. The Health Ministry said revised ICMR guidelines and efforts by states also helped in achieving
                the goal of widespread testing. Till Friday, a total of 1,58,49,068 tests for COVID-19 had been done in the 
                country. With nearly 50,000 cases (48,916) on the second consecutive day, the total number of coronavirus
                infections in India crossed the 13 lakh-mark to reach 13,36,861 on Saturday. Also, 757 deaths in the last 
                24 hours pushed the death toll to 31,358. Currently, India has 4,56,071 active cases and 8,49,431 people 
                have been treated and discharged. 63.54 per cent people recovered so far, the health ministry has said. 
                Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Cheif Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan Saturday became the first CM to test 
                positive for the novel coronavirus. He is likely to get admitted to Chirayu hospital in capital city 
                Bhopal. His reports came days after Cabinet Minister Arvind Bhadoria, who had attended a Cabinet meeting 
                and had travelled with the CM to Lucknow to attend the funeral of Governor Lalji Tandon earlier this week. 
                tested positive for the disease. Globally, 15,736,499 people have been infected and 638,577 have succumbed
                to the virus. As many as 8,986,470 recoveries have been reported so far.
